# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Installation
Clone MSCS621-concordance git repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Marist-MSCS/MSCS621-concordance.git
```

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
1. Run with Flask
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server

2. Run with uwsgi
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install uwsgi

uwsgi --http 127.0.0.1:8080 --manage-script-name --mount /=app:app
OR
uwsgi --http-socket 127.0.0.1:8080 --uid uwsgi --plugins python3 --protocol uwsgi --wsgi app:application
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/mscs721/concordance/1.0.0/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/mscs721/concordance/1.0.0/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
```

## Running with Docker Compose with front end web interface

To run the server on a Docker Compose, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building docker compose
docker-compose build

# starting up docker compose
docker-compose up
```


## Deploy app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Install the AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI. Follow install process for [Beanstalk CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html)

Deploy Application

```bash
# clone repository if not cloned already
git clone https://github.com/Marist-MSCS/MSCS621-concordance.git

# create AWS Elastic Beanstalk application
eb init -p python-3.6 <Application Name> --region us-east-2

# create AWS Elastic Beanstalk Environment
eb create <Environment Name>

#change default Elastic Beanstalk WSGI path to app.py
```


## Running tests

Tests for the appliction can be run with the following command
```
#Once the server is up and running
python swagger_server/test/run_tests.py
```
